# CarrierJumpNotification
Tool for generating in-game chat notifications for Elite:Dangerous Fleet Carrier captains

Pulls data from Elite log and creates notification based on user set pattern.

Due to the how data is saved to the logs, right now Tool can only figure out carrier pre-jump location if it was docked on the carrier in the current play session.

If you didn't land on your carrier, after pulling data, manually correct "Jump from System" field and generate notification text again.
