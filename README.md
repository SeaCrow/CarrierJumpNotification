Pulls data from Elite log and creates notification based on user set pattern.

![Tool Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaCrow/CarrierJumpNotification/master/Misc/WindowImage.png)

Due to Elite:Dangerous weird handling of text pasting into chat (paste character limit) be mindful of notification length, there is option in Settings to cut out Col XXX Sector from system names to save on length. 
For example "Col 285 Sector CC-K a38-1" will be truncated in notification to "CC-K a38-1"
